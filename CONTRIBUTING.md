# Contributing to Machine Learning with Graphs

We are thrilled that you are interested in contributing to the Machine Learning with Graphs package! This project aims to provide a comprehensive suite of graph-based machine learning algorithms, and contributions from the community are essential for its success.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold this code of conduct. Please report unacceptable behavior to [susheelg1107@gmail.com], [parikshiturs837@gmail.com].

## How Can I Contribute?

Contributions come in many forms; not just code. Here's how you can contribute:

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- **Use the GitHub Issues tracker.** Go to [issues page](https://github.com/susheelg1197/machine-learning-with-graphs-lib/issues) and use the 'new issue' button to create a report.
- **A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information.** Be as detailed as possible.
- **Reproduce the issue** with as much detail as you can provide. The more information we have, the more likely we can fix the bug.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

- **Use the GitHub Issues tracker** and provide clear and detailed explanations about the feature.
- **Provide context** and explain why you believe this feature is important. This helps everyone understand your suggestion.
- **Consider whether you're able to contribute the enhancement yourself,** and let us know!

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Machine Learning with Graphs? You can start by looking through 'beginner' and 'help-wanted' issues:

- **Beginner issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code and a test or two.
- **Help wanted issues** - issues which should be a bit more involved than 'beginner' issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the quality of the project.
- Fix problems that are important to users.
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible solution.
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions.

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Make your changes** and make sure your code is well-documented.
3. **Write relevant tests** to validate your changes.
4. **Ensure the test suite passes.**
5. **Make sure your code lints** to ensure code style consistency.
6. **Submit a pull request.**

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Python Styleguide

All Python code should adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

### Testing Styleguide

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Use [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) standards.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. The pull request will be merged once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
